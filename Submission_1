The project idea is about an e-commerce app project to develop a comprehensive 
and user-friendly online platform that facilitates the buying, selling, and borrowing of 
products with a focus on sustainability and responsible consumption. Develop an app, named is RecycleBin.
The app will work as an e-commerce site. There will be two sections for user, one is who uploads and sell products and another is who purchases or borrow products.
There will be a payment system for paying bills for products online and offline.
